        <p>From 1640 until 1796, Sri Lanka was under Dutch rule.

            <h4>Ingredients for Shrimp Sambal Belacan:</h4>
            <li> 3tbs crushed chilli</li>
            <li>100g dried skinless shrimps (roasted)</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>2 tbs ginger root, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>1 tbs olive oil</li>

            <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
            <li> Salt to taste</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>

        <ol>
            <h4>Step 1</h4>
            <li>Heat the ghee or butter in a pan, add the garlic, ginger and onion and cook 4-5 minutes until the fragrance comes out.</li>

            <p></p>

            <h4>Step 2</h4>
            <li>Then add the rice and mix well. Add the water, stock cubes, spice bunch and saffron. Cover and simmer until the rice is cooked. When cooked, remove the spice bundle.</li>

            <p></p>

            <h4>Step 3</h4>
            <li>Boil eggs for 8 minutes, remove the shells and deep fry in vegetable oil until golden brown.</li>

            <h4>Step 4</h4>
            <li>Heat the oil in a pan, put all the ingredients in together and cook for 4-5 minutes.  Remove from the heat and let it cool down. Pound together, and add sugar, lime and salt. Check the seasoning and keep on one side.</li>

            <h4>Step 5</h4>
            <li>To assemble the rice parcels, soften the banana leaves over a flame. Arrange two leaves one across the other in a shallow bowl and put three serving spoons of steamed rice in the centre. Arrange some of the three meat curry, deep-fried boiled egg, shrimp belacan and two tuna balls around the rice (see picture at the top of this post). Fold the banana leaves over the filling to enclose then secure with toothpicks. Repeat with the remaining leaves and filling. When you are ready to serve, heat the oven to 170*. Place the parcels on a baking tray, making sure the opening is at the top. Bake for 12 minutes until the banana leaves start to turn brown</li>

            <h4>Step 6</h4>
            <li> Remove from the oven, place a parcel on a plate and let your guests open them at the table - savouring the delicious aromas!</li>
